Various data-processing scripts, used to drive data generation for various
Google Sheets, my refs database, and a mod or two (before I started pulling
that into the mod-generation scripts themselves).

These scripts will invariably need access to the `bl3data` and/or
`bl3hotfixmod` libraries which live over in the `injectdata` folder, so
you'll have to symlink or copy them over in order to make use of the
scripts in here.
