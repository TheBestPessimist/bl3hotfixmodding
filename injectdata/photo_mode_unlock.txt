### Photo Mode Unlock
### by Apocalyptech
###
### Unlocks the camera in Photo Mode to be able to go extremely far.  Possibly
### not to the full extent of every level -- I've not tested thoroughly -- but
### enough to take you from the Highway FT in Droughts back to the main FT in
### that area, at least.  Also buffs up the camera move speed so that it's not
### agonizing having to go over so much terrain.  That might make lining up
### precise angles a bit harder, but c'est la vie!
