### Guardian Rank Math Fix
### by Apocalyptech
###
### Five Guardian Ranks scale up more slowly than the others - with just one
### point in them, they register at 0.99% as opposed to 1%, and at 40 points
### the difference has widened to 12.31% as opposed to 14.04%.  This mod sets
### them to scale at the same rate as the others.
###
### Now, it's worth noting that this change is only to a 'UIStat' object, and
### might possibly *only* affect the display of the numbers (so that with this
### mod enabled, the number is no longer accurate).  Or, possibly, the strength
### of the effect only depends on the number of points put into the stats, not
### the percent value, in which case this mod might be effectively nerfing the
### stat by making it approach its effective maximum more quickly.  Or,
### possibly the stat depends on the displayed percent, in which case this
### mod's a buff.
###
### So: this is either a buff, or a nerf, or does nothing but change a number
### in the UI.  Who can tell?  I suspect the latter.  Anyway, this evens the
### numbers out, whatever its other effects.
