### Fix DLC2 Shield Drops
###
### Most enemies in DLC2 (Guns, Love, and Tentacles) don't actually drop
### shields.  For standard enemies, they're in the pool list but with a
### zero weight.  For badasses, they're absent entirely from the pool
### list.  We're fixing the Standard ones, but not bothering with Badasses
### for now.
