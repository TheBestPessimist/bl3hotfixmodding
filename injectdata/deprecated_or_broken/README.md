## Deprecated Mods

So far, the deprecated mods in here are related to the 10-Year Anniversary
events which took place shortly after BL3's release.  With the November 21,
2019 patch (Mayhem 4 / Maliwan Takedown), nearly all gear was given a
dedicated source, which is slightly at odds with the mods now found here.
Some bits of functionality from these have been merged into Better Loot,
though.

- `2019-10-01_-_10-year-anniversary-event-1_-_bonus_boss_loot.txt` - This
  is the Week 1 event, as sent by GBX itself.
- `better_bonus_boss_loot.txt` - This is a better (ie: OP and cheaty) version
  of the Week 1 event, which guarantees that all affected bosses will drop
  from their pools.

## Failed Attempts

These are some mod attempts that I've yet to actually get working at all.  So
don't look at these thinking that they're any good.  :)

- `always_visible_challenge_icons.txt` - Some attempts to make challenge icons
  (Claptrap salvages, Radios, etc) always appear on the map, regardless of if
  you've been close to them.
- `cdh.txt` - Just a quick attempt to see if `bDropOnDeath` still existed in
  item pools, even though it didn't look that it did.  Either it doesn't, or
  there's other problems with my attempts.  :)
- `faster_cost_spin.txt` - An attempt to get the cost spinner to resolve to
  the cost much more quickly, when mousing around items.  Not sure why this
  doesn't work, but I suspect that perhaps the object doesn't exist at the
  time that the hotfix executes?
- `movement_speed.txt` - An attempt to speed up character movement.  Didn't
  really expect this to work - I should give it another go.
- `no_delay_red_chests.txt` - An attempt to remove the 30-minute in-game
  delay between re-opening red chests.
- `bloody_harvest_challenges.txt` - An attempt to cheat the Bloody Harvest
  challenges to have lower target numbers.  Total fail!
- `guaranteed_badasses.txt` - A few little attempts to increase the number
  of Badasses.  Didn't do the trick, alas.
