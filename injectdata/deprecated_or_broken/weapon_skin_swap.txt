### Weapon Skin Swap
### by Apocalyptech
###
### Proof of concept - makes the Ghoul Metal Grey skin actually provide the
### Superstreamer skin, when applied to a Tediore shotgun.  Doesn't affect any
### other manufacturer/weapontype combination, though, since skins are particular
### like that.
###
### Mostly just wanted to see if it could be done; no plans to convert this
### into a Real Mod.
