### Heart of Gold: Better Gifts
###
### I always felt that the gifts you get from Joy in the mission 'Heart
### of Gold' are a bit pathetic.  Not that you need the resources or
### anything, but IMO it'd be nicer if it turned out that Joy was sitting
### on a small fortune all this time.
###
### Buffing this up to *actually* impressive levels isn't really possible
### but we can at least bump up the quantity and throw in Eridium as well,
### which may make it seem more impressive.
