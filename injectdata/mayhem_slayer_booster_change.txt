### Mayhem 2.0: Change Slayer Boosters
### by Apocalyptech
###
### The Mayhem 2.0 Easy modifier 'Slayer' drops shield boosters by default, which
### can interfere with roid-shield-based melee builds.  This changes those booster
### drops to be either health charges or damage-reduction charges instead.
