### Disable Bloody Harvest.  Theoretically.
###
### This hasn't been tested out yet, but I suspect that this could
### be used to disable the Bloody Harvest event prematurely, in
### case you're sick of all the ghosts or something.
###
### Since the object is an array, this hotfix could potentially
### disable other events which happens to be active, as well.
###
### NOTE: Untested!
